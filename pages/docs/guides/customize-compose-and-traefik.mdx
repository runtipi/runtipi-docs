# Customize main docker compose and traefik config

In this guide, we'll show you how to customize the default docker compose file of runtipi and the traefik config.

<Callout type="warning">
  This guide is for advanced users who are familiar with docker and traefik. If you break the config
  we won't be able to help you.
</Callout>

## Example use cases

- Enable the traefik dashboard
- Change the log level of traefik to `DEBUG`

## Create a custom docker compose file

In this example we will expose the traefik dashboard by editing the main runtipi compose file.

Firstly we need to figure out what port traefik dashboard uses (which is 8080) and what is the name of the docker container of traefik (which we can learn from the `docker-compose.yml`) which is `runtipi-reverse-proxy` in this case.

<Callout>
  Don't edit the `docker-compose.yml` file directly because it will be overwritten in every restart
  of runtipi.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Create the custom docker compose file

Create the file `tipi-compose.yml` in the `user-config` directory within the `runtipi` folder:

```bash
nano user-config/tipi-compose.yml
```

### Add your changes

For this example add the following contents:

```yaml
services:
  runtipi-reverse-proxy:
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

Then save and exit.

### Check your file structure

You should have this file structure:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="runtipi" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="user-config" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="tipi-compose.yml" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Restart runtipi and test the changes

```bash
./runtipi-cli restart
```

After restarting you should be able to see the traefik dashboard by visiting [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:8080) (in your runtipi server)

</Steps>

## Edit the traefik config file

In this example we will just change the log level of traefik to `DEBUG`, that is a very simple example to showcase the process.

Firstly we need to figure out what we need to change, the default traefik config of runtipi is this:

```yaml
api:
  dashboard: true
  insecure: true

providers:
  docker:
    endpoint: 'unix:///var/run/docker.sock'
    watch: true
    exposedByDefault: false
  file:
    directory: /root/.config/dynamic
    watch: true

entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ':80'
  websecure:
    address: ':443'
    http:
      tls:
        certResolver: myresolver

certificatesResolvers:
  myresolver:
    acme:
      email: acme@thisprops.com
      storage: /shared/acme.json
      httpChallenge:
        entryPoint: web

log:
  level: ERROR
```

We can see that the part we need to change is this:

```yaml
log:
  level: ERROR
```

By default if you try to edit the traefik config it will be overwritten on every restart. To keep the config we just need to change a small thing in the settings
which can be done easily with 2 steps.

<Steps>

### Open the runtipi settings file

Open the `state/settings.json` file with your prefered editor. We will use `nano` in this example.

```bash
nano state/setting.json
```

Make sure this is performed within the `runtipi` directory.

### Modify the the settings

Your settings file will look something like this:

```json
{
  "dnsIp": "9.9.9.9",
  "internalIp": "10.10.10.5",
  "postgresPort": 5432,
  "appsRepoUrl": "https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi-appstore",
  "domain": "example.com",
  "appDataPath": "/home/runtipi/runtipi/",
  "localDomain": "tipi.lan",
  "demoMode": false,
  "guestDashboard": false,
  "allowAutoThemes": true,
  "allowErrorMonitoring": true,
  "persistTraefikConfig": false
}
```

Here you just need to change the `"persistTraefikConfig"` from `false` to `true`, then you can save and exit with `Ctrl+X` then `y` and `Enter`.

Now runtipi will not reset the traefik config, you can always change it back to `true` to reset your changes. So now that our config is persistent we
can safely make our changes by opening the `traefik/traefik.yml` file and changing this:

```yaml
log:
  level: ERROR
```

To this:

```yaml
log:
  level: DEBUG
```

Now you can save the file (`Ctrl+X` then `y` and `Enter` if you are using nano).

### Test the changes

Lastly restart runtipi with this command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli restart
```

Congratulations! Now your traefik container will run in debug mode so you can fix some problem for example.
