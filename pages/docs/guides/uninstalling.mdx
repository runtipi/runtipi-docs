# Uninstalling

Make sure runtipi is completely stopped and then remove the `runtipi` directory.

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli stop
cd ..
sudo rm -rf runtipi
```

If you want to purge every docker image/volume/network created too you can run this command:

```bash
docker volume prune
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)
```
