# Customize app config

## Overview

In this guide, we'll show you how to customize the configuration of an app by overriding the default `docker-compose.yml` and `app.env` files.

## Example use cases

- Set `Pihole` to listen on a custom IP address
- Mount an existing volume on your host into a media app such as `Jellyfin`. _By default, media apps will only be able to see files within `runtipi/media`, but you can add other volumes._

An alternative approach to mounting a volume into an app would be to symlink your host volume into `runtipi/media`. However, that would make it visible to all apps that mount the `media` folder, which may not be desirable.

## Create custom docker config

In this example we're going to add environment variables to the `Pihole` app and mount the `/cellar` volume into the `Jellyfin` app.

To determine how to set environment variables to customize the `Pihole` container, we look at `runtipi/apps/pihole/docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
ports:
  - ${NETWORK_INTERFACE:-0.0.0.0}:53:53/tcp
  - ${NETWORK_INTERFACE:-0.0.0.0}:53:53/udp
  - ${NETWORK_INTERFACE:-0.0.0.0}:${APP_PORT}:80
```

From this, we know that we need to set the `NETWORK_INTERFACE` variable.

<Callout>
  Don't edit the files in the `apps` folder directly; they will be overwritten on update.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Create the folders

Create `user-config` folder within `runtipi` and a folder for each app:

```bash
cd runtipi
mkdir user-config
mkdir user-config/jellyfin
mkdir user-config/pihole
```

### Create the custom config

Create a `docker-compose.yml` for `jellyfin` and add this content:

```bash
touch user-config/jellyfin/docker-compose.yml
nano user-config/jellyfin/docker-compose.yml
```

```yml
services:
  jellyfin:
    volumes:
      - /cellar:/cellar
```

<Callout>Replace `/cellar` with the volume you want to mount.</Callout>

### Modify the environment files

Create an `app.env` for `pihole` and add this content:

```bash
touch user-config/pihole/app.env
nano user-config/pihole/app.env
```

```conf
NETWORK_INTERFACE=10.20.0.53
```

<Callout>Replace `10.20.0.53` with the IP address you want pihole to listen on.</Callout>

### Check your file structure

You should end up with a structure like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="runtipi" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="app-data" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="apps" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="user-config" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="jellyfin" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="docker-compose.yml" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="pihole" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="app.env" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Restart the apps and test

```bash
./runtipi-cli app stop jellyfin
./runtipi-cli app stop pihole
./runtipi-cli app start jellyfin
./runtipi-cli app start pihole
```

</Steps>

- Test Jellyfin by opening the app and configuring a library. You should now see your mounted volume.
- Test Pihole with a DNS query to the new IP address:

```bash
nslookup google.com 10.20.0.53
```

```
Server:         10.20.0.53
Address:        10.20.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   google.com
Address: 142.250.200.46
Name:   google.com
Address: 2a00:1450:4009:822::200e
```
