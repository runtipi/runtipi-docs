# Auto backup your apps using cron

In this guide we will show you how to automate backing up all your apps every week, month or day using tipi's
new backup feature.

Thanks a lot to [Lancelot-Enguerrand](https://github.com/Lancelot-Enguerrand) for putting this script together.

<Callout type="warning">This script requires runtipi verion `v3.5.0` or above.</Callout>

## Setup

<Steps>

### Create the backup script

Create a new script file (`.sh` extension) in the `runtipi/scripts` folder (if the folder doesn't exist you can create it manually)
called `backup-apps.sh` and paste the following code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: ./backup_runtipi_apps.sh [daily|weekly|monthly] [stop|ignore] [path/to/BackupListFile]
# Default parameters are daily stop

# Specify your runtipi base path
tipiPath=""

# Storage path for the Apps (each app have a folder inside)
backupPath="$tipiPath/backups"

# Specify backup retention - Indicate number of backup file to keep for each schedule
dailyRetention=3
weeklyRetention=3
monthlyRetention=3

# Default runtipi paths
appsDataPath="$tipiPath/app-data"
appsPath="$tipiPath/apps"
userConfigsPath="$tipiPath/user-config"

# Define the temporary directory for the archive creation
archiveCreatingWorkDir="/tmp"

# App status - Set defaut value to prevent bug - do not touch
appOrginalStatus='started'

# Check for runtipi path value
if [ -z "$tipiPath" ]; then
    echo "Runtipi path not specified"
    echo "Edit path, line 6 in $0"
    exit 1
elif [ -d "$tipiPath" ]; then
    echo "Runtipi path : $tipiPath"
else
    echo "Runtipi path not found : $tipiPath"
    echo "Edit path, line 6 in $0"
    exit 1
fi

# Default Parameters
backupTypeDefaultValue='daily'
stopAppDefaultValue='stop'
backupListDefaultValue=$(ls $appsDataPath)

# Define retention policy
backupType="${1:-$backupTypeDefaultValue}"
# Change keepLast to adjust retention policy
case "$backupType" in
    daily)
        keepLast=$dailyRetention
        ;;
    weekly)
        keepLast=$weeklyRetention
        ;;
    monthly)
        keepLast=$monthlyRetention
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid backup type specified. Use 'daily', 'weekly' or 'monthly'."
        exit 2
        ;;
esac

# Should Apps be stopped during backup
stopApp="${2:-$stopAppDefaultValue}"

# Should Apps be stopped during backup
refBackupList=$3
if [ -z "$refBackupList" ]; then
    backupList=$backupListDefaultValue
elif [ -f "$refBackupList" ]; then
    backupList=$(cat $refBackupList)
else
    echo "Invalid path for backup list reference file."
    exit 3
fi

# List all installed apps
for app in $(ls $appsPath)
do
    # List all apps in backup reference list
    for element in $backupList
    do
        # Check if app is installed
        if [ "$app" = "$element" ]; then
            # Stop the app if it was asked
            if [ "$stopApp" = 'stop' ]; then
                cd $tipiPath
                appStatusCheck=$(docker ps -f name=^/$app$ -q)
                if [ -z "$appStatusCheck" ]; then
                    appOrginalStatus='stopped'
                    echo "App $app is already stopped"
                else
                    appOrginalStatus='started'
                    echo "Stopping $app"
                    ./runtipi-cli app stop $app
                fi
            fi

            echo "Preparing $app backup"
            # Set destination app path
            backupAppPath="$backupPath/$app"
            # Create destination directory if doesnt exist
            if [ ! -d "$backupAppPath" ]; then mkdir -p "$backupAppPath"; fi
            # Generate archive name
            backupFileName="$app-$backupType-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d').tar.gz"

            # Uncomment next line if you want the archive to be created directly in backup destination
            ## archiveCreatingWorkDir="$backupAppPath"

            # Move to Working Directory for archive creation
            cd $archiveCreatingWorkDir

            # Declare source and destination path for directories in archive
            declare -A app_paths=(
                ["$appsPath/$app"]="app"
                ["$appsDataPath/$app"]="app-data"
                ["$userConfigsPath/$app"]="user-config"
            )

            echo "Preparing $app files"
            tempArchiveDir=$(mktemp -d)
            for src in "${!app_paths[@]}"; do
                dest="$tempArchiveDir/${app_paths[$src]}"
                echo $dest
                # Ensure the directory exists
                if [ -d "$src" ]; then
                    # Create symbolic link for each directory
                    ln -s "$src" "$dest"
                else
                    echo "Directory $src does not exist, skipped."
                fi
            done

            # Creating archive
            echo "Creating $app archive : $backupFileName"
            tar -czhf "$backupFileName" -C "$tempArchiveDir" .
            # Move archive to Backup storage
            echo "Moving $backupFileName to $backupAppPath"
            mv "$backupFileName" "$backupAppPath"
            # Remove temporary Directory
            echo "Removing temporary files"
            rm -rf "$tempArchiveDir"

            # Purge old backups of the same type
            cd "$backupAppPath"
            echo "Purging old $backupType backup for $app"
            ls -t | grep "$app-$backupType-" | tail -n +$((keepLast+1)) | xargs -r rm --

            # Restart the app if it was asked to be stopped
            if [ "$stopApp" = 'stop' -a "$appOrginalStatus" = 'started' ]; then
                cd $tipiPath
                echo "Starting $app"
                ./runtipi-cli app start $app
            fi
        fi
    done
done
```

The script takes 3 arguments:

| Accepted Values            | Description                                                                                                        | Default | Required |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `monthly`,`weekly`,`daily` | Set the name of the final backup, for example if you use `daily` the backup name will be `myapp-daily-date.tar.gz` | `daily` | no       |
| `stop`,`ignore`            | Stop the app before backing up or backup anyway.                                                                   | `stop`  | no       |
| `path`                     | Specify a path to a file describing what apps you want to backup, each app id in a new line.                       | `none`  | no       |

The script also allows you to change for how long you want to keep backups, this can be configured by chaning the following values:

```bash
dailyRetention=3
weeklyRetention=3
monthlyRetention=3
```

Each number indicates the retention period for the backup, specifying how many cycles it should be kept before deletion. For instance, a daily backup will be deleted after 3 days, while a monthly backup will be deleted after 3 months etc.

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure to change the `tipiPath` in the script to point to your actual runtipi path.
</Callout>

### Make the script executable

In order for cron to run the script we need to make it executable, this can easily be done with the
following command:

```bash
chmod +x backup-apps.sh
```

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure you are in the `runtipi/scripts` directory before running the command above.
</Callout>

### Add the script to cron

Now it's time to add our script to crontab. We firstly need to open the crontab file using this command:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Then we can add our crontab line, in this example we will backup our apps every Monday at 10 p.m.

```bash
0 22 * * 0 /path/to/runtipi/scripts/backup-apps.sh weekly
```

After adding our line we can save and exit and that's it! Now your apps will backup automatically!
