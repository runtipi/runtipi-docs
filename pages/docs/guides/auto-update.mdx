# Auto Updating Tipi

This is a quick script and cronjob setup that will try to keep Tipi auto updated once per day at midnight.
For this example, the path to our runtipi directory will be /root/runtipi. If your install location is different, please adjust the below commands to reflect that path.
This has been tested with Ubuntu

## Install requirements for the script

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip 
sudo pip install lastversion
```


## Create the script that will check for updates

In your runtipi directory, create the file "check-update.sh" and add the following contents:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Edit this to reflect your path to your runtipi directory
Tipi_path="/root/runtipi"

cd $Tipi_path

# Get the current version installed
current_version=$(./runtipi-cli --version | grep -v Welcome )

# Get the current version on Github
latest_version=$(lastversion https://github.com/runtipi)

if [[ "$(printf '%s\n' "$current_version" "$latest_version" | sort -V | tail -n1)" == "$current_version" ]]; then

  echo "Current version is up to date."

else
  update_version="v${latest_version}"
  ./runtipi-cli update "${update_version}"
fi
```

Now, we need to set the file to be executable with"
```bash
chmod 755 /root/runtipi/check-update.sh
```

## Cron Script for daily update checks

Run 
```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

If prompted, pick your desired editor and insert the following:
```bash
0 0 * * * /root/runtipi/check-update.sh
```

Next, we will restart cron to make sure the changes get picked up right away.
```bash
sudo systemctl restart cron
```
