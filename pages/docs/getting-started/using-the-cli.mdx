# Using the CLI

The runtipi-cli is a command line tool that allows you to start, stop, restart, update, and manage runtipi from the command line.

Usage:

```bash
./runtipi-cli command options
```

## Start Command

To start runtipi run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli start
```

<Callout type="info">
  Runtipi is run as root in the examples because during the start process it needs to check and
  eventually change the permissions of some files in the `runtipi` folder. You can run the command
  without sudo if needed but you may encounter permission issues.
</Callout>

## Stop Command

To stop runtipi run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli stop
```

## Restart Command

To restart runtipi from the command line run this command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli restart
```

## Update

This command updates runtipi to the latest version available.

You can update to the latest version with this command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli update latest
```

If you want to update to a specific version you give the version number as an argument:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli update v2.0.7
```

<Callout type="warning">
  You can downgrade runtipi to a previous version by running the update command with the version you
  want to downgrade to. However, this is highly discouraged as it may lead to breaking your install.
  Make sure you know what you are doing.
</Callout>

## Reset password command
