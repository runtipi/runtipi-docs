# Installation

## Introduction

This guide will help you install Tipi on your server. Make sure your server is secured and you have followed basic security practices before installing Tipi. (e.g. firewall, ssh keys, root access, etc.) Here is a [good guide](https://www.tecmint.com/initial-ubuntu-server-setup-guide/) to follow.


## Hardware Requirements

Our software uses containerization and has the same hardware requirements as Docker:

### Minimum Requirements

- A 64-bit processor
- 4GB of RAM
- 10GB free disk space

### Recommended Requirements

- A modern multi-core processor
- 8GB of RAM or more
- 20GB free SSD disk space

### Supported Architectures

- x86_64/amd64
- arm64

## OS Requirements


Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or higher is recommended. However other major Linux distribution are supported but may lead to installation issues.
Please file an issue if you encounter one.

If Docker is already installed on your machine, Tipi will use it to run the dashboard. Otherwise, it will install Docker for you.

<Callout type="warning">
If you already have docker installed make sure to have the docker compose plugin installed.<br/>
Run `docker compose version` to check if it is installed. Instructions to install it can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
If you already have docker installed make sure you used the official docker install script from [here](https://get.docker.sh) as this 
guarantees that you have the latest build. If you used a command like ```sudo apt install docker.io``` you may have an outdated version and
issues may occur.

## Download and install Tipi

Download the latest version of Tipi:

```bash
curl -L https://setup.runtipi.io | bash
```

If you have some issue with the command above, you can also download the script directly from github:
  
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtipi/runtipi/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

## Update 

This command updates tipi to the latest version available.

You can update to the latest version with this command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli update latest
```

If you want to specify a specific version to update or downgrade to you can use the command 
like this:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli update v2.0.7
```

<Callout type="warning">
You can downgrade Tipi to a previous version by running the update command with the version you want to downgrade to.
However, this is highly discouraged as it may lead to breaking your install.
