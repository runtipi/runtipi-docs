# Installation

## Introduction

This guide will help you install runtipi on your server. Make sure your server is secured and you have followed basic security practices before installing Tipi. (e.g. firewall, ssh keys, root access, etc.) Here is a [good guide](https://www.tecmint.com/initial-ubuntu-server-setup-guide/) to follow.

## Hardware Requirements

Our software uses containerization and has the same hardware requirements as Docker:

### Minimum Requirements

- A 64-bit processor
- 4GB of RAM
- 10GB free disk space

### Recommended Requirements

- A modern multi-core processor
- 8GB of RAM or more
- 20GB free SSD disk space

### Supported Architectures

- x86_64/amd64
- arm64

<Callout>
  Not all apps are supported in the arm64 architecture, runtipi will auto hide apps that are not
  supported by your architecture.
</Callout>

## OS Requirements

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or higher is recommended. However other major Linux distribution are supported but may lead to installation issues.
Please file an issue if you encounter one.

If Docker is already installed on your machine, runtipi will use it to run the dashboard. Otherwise, it will install Docker for you.

<Callout type="warning">
  If you already have docker installed make sure to have the docker compose plugin installed. Run
  `docker compose version` to check if it is installed. Instructions to install it can be found
  [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  If you already have docker installed make sure you used the official docker install script from
  [here](https://get.docker.sh) as this guarantees that you have the latest build. If you used a
  command like ```sudo apt install docker.io``` you may have an outdated version and issues may
  occur.

## VPS users

If you intend to self-host stuff on a VPS consider if it is a good or bad idea. Whether you use Runtipi or not, it is most of the time a bad idea. Except if you put the correct security measures in place.

When you install Runtipi on a VPS it is immediately vulnerable and open to the world through its public IP. The same goes for all apps you will install down the line through their respective ports.

If you still want to run on a VPS, here are a few steps to consider in order to increase your safety:

- Setup a firewall and ensure it is impossible to access a running service from ip:port
- Install a VPN like tailscale to create a secure and trusted private network to access your apps.
- If an app needs to be accessed from the public, always use a tunnel and set it up specifically for this app

## Download and install runtipi

Download the latest version of runtipi:

```bash
curl -L https://setup.runtipi.io | bash
```

If you have some issue with the command above, you can also download the script directly from github:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtipi/runtipi/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

## Update

This command updates runtipi to the latest version available.

You can update to the latest version with this command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli update latest
```

If you want to specify a specific version to update or downgrade to you can use the command
like this:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli update v2.0.7
```

<Callout type="warning">
  You can downgrade runtipi to a previous version by running the update command with the version you
  want to downgrade to. However, this is highly discouraged as it may lead to breaking your install.
