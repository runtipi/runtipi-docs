### Prerequisites
- Docker desktop up to date and running. Instructions: [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Docker-compose
- Node version 16+

### Prepare
Once you have forked the repo and cloned it on your local machine you can start to prepare the environment.

### Install dependencies
Tipi uses `pnpm` as a package manager and monorepo orchestrator. Install it with
`npm i -g pnpm`

Install the project dependencies
`pnpm i`

### Run Tipi
1. Start the app with `npm run start:dev` from the root folder
2. Visit `localhost:3000/dashboard` in your browser

### Stopping
When you have finished developing and stopped the server, the apps you've installed will still be running in their containers. To stop them and remove the images run:
`sudo ./scripts/stop.sh`

### Using your own appstore repo
You can change the repository Tipi is using to retrieve the appstore in order to test new apps you added.

Create a `settings.json` file in the `state` folder (`runtipi/state/settings.json`) containing the URL of your repo

```settings.json
{
  "appsRepoUrl": "https://github.com/meienberger/runtipi-appstore.git",
}
```

If you need to be on a different branch than the main one in your repo, go in the repository directory `cd ./repos/<generated-id>` and checkout your branch.

```bash
git checkout mybranch
```
