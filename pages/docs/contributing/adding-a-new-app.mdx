# Adding a new app

<Callout>
In order to proceed you should be familiar working with the Terminal and Git.
</Callout>

In this guide, we will explain how to add a new app to the Runtipi App Store. The process is pretty simple and should take you less than 20 minutes. 

### Prerequisites
- The app you want to add is free and open-source (or at least source available with a permissive license for personal use)
- The app you want to add has an official and maintained docker image


## Fork the repo

In order to open a pull request you need to fork the repo. Visit the official [App Store repo](https://github.com/meienberger/runtipi-appstore) and start by clicking the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the page.
This will create a new repository with your name and an identical structure to the original repo.

## Clone the repo locally

On your computer clone the repo you just forked.

```bash
git clone https://<your-github-username>/meienberger/runtipi-appstore
```

## Create a new branch for your app
Navigate to the repoisitory you just cloned.

```bash
cd runtipi-appstore
```

Create a new branch for your app.

```bash
git checkout -b app/<app-name>
```

## Create the app files

Each app requires at least the following files:
- A `docker-compose.yml` file to run your app
- A `config.json` file to configure your app
- A description in markdown format
- A logo in jpg format (512 x 512px)

Inside the repo open the `apps` folder and create a new folder for your app. The name should be the same as the app name without spaces or capital letters.

Create a new `config.json` file inside the newly create folder

```json
{
  "name": "My super app",
  "available": true,
  "port": 8100,
  "exposable": true,
  "id": "my-app", # This should be the same name as the folder
  "description": "", # Long description of the app
  "tipi_version": 1, # Always 1 if you are adding a new app
  "version": "1.25.1", # The actual version of the app (not the tipi version)
  "categories": ["utilities"], # One or more categories for the app
  "short_desc": "", # Short description of the app
  "author": "", # Link or name of the author 
  "source": "", # Link for git repo
  "website": "", # Link to the official website
  "form_fields": [] # Used to ask for more info to the user before installing. Will be explained further
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Be sure to remove the comments from the example above an that the final content is a valid JSON format. You can easily check for validity in an online tool like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/)
</Callout>

Available categories : `utilities`, `network`, `media`, `development`, `automation`, `social`, `utilities`, `photography`, `security`, `featured`, `books`, `data`, `music`, `finance`, `ai`

Other options for the `config.json` file are:

| Option         | Description     | Example value |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| **force_expose** | If set to true, the app will require a domain name. | true |
| **generate_vapid_keys** | If set to true, the app will generate VAPID keys for web push notifications. `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` will be available as environment variables | true |
| **url_suffix** | If set, the app will be accessible at `https://<your-domain>/<url_suffix>` | my-app |
| **https** | If set to true, the app will be accessible via https only. | true |
| **no_gui** | Set to true for apps with no GUI. Open button will be hidden | true |
| **supported_architectures** | If the app is only available for a specific architecture, you can specify it here. | ["arm64", "amd64"] |

If you want to add a new category, please open a new issue.

When choosing a port, please make sure that it is not in use already. You can check [tipi.community/app-db](https://tipi.community/app-db) for an updated list. Feel free to let us know if there are any missing ones!

In the same folder, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with your app config.

```yml
version: "3.9"
services:
  my-app: # Should be exact same name as "id" field in config.json
    container_name: my-app  # Should be exact same name as "id" field in config.json
    image: my-app:1.0.0 # Try to avoid "latest" tag. As it may break configs in the future.
    environment:
      - TZ=${TZ} # Can use any env variable. List in runtipi/templates/env-sample
    volumes:
      - ${APP_DATA_DIR}/data/config:/config # Always start the path with ${APP_DATA_DIR}. This will put all data inside app-data/my-app/data
      - ${APP_DATA_DIR}/data/projects:/projects
    ports:
      - ${APP_PORT}:8443
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - tipi_main_network
```

You'll also need to create a `metadata` folder and inside put the following files:
- `description.md` - Long description of the app in markdown format. (see other apps for inspiration)
- `logo.jpg` - Logo of the app in jpg format (512 x 512px) make sure the logo looks good in the dashboard

## User defined environment variables
Sometimes an app is requiring more info to run it such as passwords or username. You can leverage the `form_fields` property in the `config.json` file to ask such information. Let's take for example Nextcloud. The image requires a username and password. We can simply add two fields in the config.json that will be presented to the user before installing.

```json
{
  ...
  "form_fields": [
    {
        "type": "text",
        "label": "Username",
        "max": 50,
        "min": 3,
        "required": true,
        "env_variable": "NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER"
    },
    {
        "type": "password",
        "label": "Password",
        "max": 50,
        "min": 3,
        "required": true,
        "env_variable": "NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can choose between different types of fields. The app will automatically validate the user input before submitting.

| Type         | Description     | Example value |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| **text**     | Just a string of text      | username       |
| **password** | Will be hidden on typing  | password       |
| **email** | An email address | test@example.org |
| **number** | Any number | 123 |
| **fqdn** | Fully qualified domain name | example.org |
| **ip** | Any valid ipv4 address | 192.168.2.100 |
| **fqdnip** | Combination between ip and fqdn | 192.168.2.100 or example.org |
| **random** | Generate a random value for the user | 2m3ffc0923rk93df9023f9 |
| **boolean** | A checkbox | true or false |

You can also define a min and max length of input with the corresponding properties.
The `env_variable` property is the name of the variable you'll use in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Be sure to have a unique name.

<Callout type="info">
  When using the field type random for a password or secret, the min value will be used to determine the length of the string. If the min value is omitted the default length is 32 characters.
</Callout>

So if we take the Nextcloud example again, this is how you would use the `form_fields` inside your compose file.

```yml
version: "3.7"

services:
  nextcloud:
    container_name: nextcloud
    image: nextcloud:23.0.3-apache
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - ${APP_PORT}:80
    volumes:
      - ${APP_DATA_DIR}/data/nextcloud:/var/www/html
    environment:
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER=${NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER}
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD}
```

`NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER` and `NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` are coming from the user inputs.

### Regex validation

You can validate a user input against a regex:

```json
{
   "env_variable": "version",
   "label": "Version",
   "pattern_error": "Version must be in the format x.y.z",
   "regex": "^[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+$",
   "required": true,
   "type": "text"
}
```

The regex will be tested against the user input. If it doesn't match, the user will see the error message defined in `pattern_error`.

### Multi select

You can also define a multi select field. This will be rendered as a dropdown in the UI.

```json
{
  "label": "Select your favorite fruits",
  "type": "text",
  "required": true,
  "options": [
    { "label": "Apple", "value": "apple" },
    { "label": "Banana", "value": "banana" },
    { "label": "Orange", "value": "orange" },
  ],
  "env_variable": "fruits"
}
```

## Default data folder
If your app requires default files or configuration, you can easily provide those by creating a `data` folder beside the app config.

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="runtipi" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="my-app" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="config.json" />
          <FileTree.File name="docker-compose.yml" />
          <FileTree.Folder name="data" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="anything.conf" />
          </FileTree.Folder>
          <FileTree.Folder name="metadata" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="description.md" />
            <FileTree.File name="logo.jpg" />
          </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Anything placed under data will be copied over `app-data/<app-id>/data` before installation. Then you can mount those files inside your compose file.

```yml
my-app:
    container_name: my-app
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ${APP_DATA_DIR}/data:/var/lib/config # Will mount the folder with `anything.conf` inside
```

## Commit your changes

Once you're done, you can commit your changes to the repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add my-app"
git push origin master
```

## Submit a Pull Request

You can now submit a pull request to the repository.
- On GitHub, visit your repository and click on the "Pull requests" tab.
- Click on "New pull request" and fill in the title and description.
- Choose your branch and target the main repository at `meienberger/runtipi-appstore`.

## Test your app in your own instance

Before submitting your app, you can test it in your own instance. You can do so by adding your app repository to the `appsRepoUrl` property in the `settings.json` file.
