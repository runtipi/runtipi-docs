# Adding a new app

<Callout emoji="🚨">
  Unfortunately, we are no longer accepting pull requests from external collaborators due to the
  high volume of PRs we have to deal with daily.

We have reached a point in which it has become too complicated to validate, test and maintain this huge amount of apps resulting in a poor experience for our users.

We are working at the moment to implement a new feature to allow you to add multiple app stores to your Runtipi instance, so you can add your own apps without the need
to send a PR to our repository.

This feature will be available very soon, so stay tuned!

You can still follow this guide and add your custom apps to your own instance through the `appsRepoUrl` property in the `settings.json` file.

</Callout>

In this guide, we will show you how to add a new app to the Runtipi App Store. The process is pretty simple and should take you less than 20 minutes.

<Callout>In order to proceed you should be familiar working with the Terminal and Git.</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- The app you want to add is free and open-source (or at least source available with a permissive license for personal use)
- The app you want to add has an official and maintained docker image

## Let's add the app

<Steps>

### Fork the repository

In order to open a pull request you need to fork the repository. Visit the official [App Store repository](https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi-appstore) and start by clicking the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the page.
This will create a new repository with your name and an identical structure to the original repository.

### Clone the repository locally

On your computer clone the repository you just forked.

```bash
git clone https://<your-github-username>/runtipi/runtipi-appstore
```

### Create a new branch for your app

Navigate to the repoisitory you just cloned.

```bash
cd runtipi-appstore
```

Create a new branch for your app.

```bash
git checkout -b app/<app-name>
```

### Create the app files

Each app requires at least these files:

- A `docker-compose.yml` file to run your app
- A `config.json` file to configure your app
- A description in markdown format
- A logo in jpg format `512x512` pixels)

Inside the repository open the `apps` folder and create a new folder for your app. The name should be the same as the app name without spaces or capital letters.

#### The `config.json` file

Create a new `config.json` file inside the newly created folder:

```json
{
  "name": "My super app",
  "id": "my-super-app",
  "available": true,
  "short_desc": "Its an awesome app!",
  "author": "me",
  "port": 8685,
  "categories": ["development", "ai"],
  "description": "This app does x thing and y thing.",
  "tipi_version": 1,
  "version": "v1.5.7",
  "source": "https://github.com/me/my-awesome-app",
  "exposable": true,
  "supported_architectures": ["arm64", "amd64"],
  "created_at": 1724134338800,
  "updated_at": 1724134338800
}
```

<Callout>
  This `config.json` file contains all the minimum required options. Check out the [reference
  table](/docs/reference/config-json) for all available options.
</Callout>

Available categories : `utilities`, `network`, `media`, `development`, `automation`, `social`, `utilities`, `photography`, `security`, `featured`, `books`, `data`, `music`, `finance`, `ai`. If you want to add a new category, please open a new issue.

When choosing a port, please make sure that it is not in use already. You can check by using the search feature in your editor (for example the search icon on Visual Studio Code). You can also visit the
[App Store repository](https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi-appstore) and look the README.md file for the list of used ports for each app.

Sometimes an app is requiring more info to run it such as passwords or username. You can leverage the `form_fields` property in the `config.json` file to ask such information. Let's take for example Nextcloud. The image requires a username and password. We can simply add two fields in the config.json that will be presented to the user before installing.

```json
{
  "form_fields": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "label": "Username",
      "max": 50,
      "min": 3,
      "required": true,
      "env_variable": "NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER"
    },
    {
      "type": "password",
      "label": "Password",
      "max": 50,
      "min": 3,
      "required": true,
      "env_variable": "NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can choose between different types of fields. The app will automatically validate the user input before submitting.

| Type         | Description                          | Example value                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **text**     | Just a string of text                | username                     |
| **password** | Will be hidden on typing             | password                     |
| **email**    | An email address                     | test@example.org             |

| **fqdn**     | Fully qualified domain name          | example.org                  |
| **ip**       | Any valid ipv4 address               | 192.168.2.100                |
| **fqdnip**   | Combination between ip and fqdn      | 192.168.2.100 or example.org |
| **random**   | Generate a random value for the user | 2m3ffc0923rk93df9023f9       |
| **boolean**  | A checkbox                           | true or false                |

Here is also a table of what a `form_field` object requires:

| Name              | Description                                                                                        | Example value                              | Required |

  When using the field type random for a password or secret, the min value will be used to determine
  the length of the string. If the min value is omitted the default length is 32 characters.
</Callout>

Here is how to use the form fields in your docker compose file:

```yaml
services:
  nextcloud:
    container_name: nextcloud
    image: nextcloud:23.0.3-apache
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - ${APP_PORT}:80
    volumes:
      - ${APP_DATA_DIR}/data/nextcloud:/var/www/html
    environment:
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER=${NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER}
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD}
```

`NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER` and `NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` are coming from the user inputs example above.

Now let's take a look at the `options` option in the form fields, this will be rendered as dropdown in the UI. You can use them like this:

```json
{
  "label": "Select your favorite fruits",
  "type": "text",
  "required": true,
  "options": [
    { "label": "Apple", "value": "apple" },
    { "label": "Banana", "value": "banana" },
    { "label": "Orange", "value": "orange" }
  ],
  "env_variable": "fruits"
}
```

#### The `docker-compose.yml` file

In the same folder, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with your app config.

```yml
version: '3.9'
services:
  my-app: # Should be exact same name as "id" field in config.json
    container_name: my-app # Should be exact same name as "id" field in config.json
    image: my-app:1.0.0 # Try to avoid "latest" tag. As it may break configs in the future.
    restart: unless-stopped # Do not change this
    environment:
      - TZ=${TZ} # Can use any env variable. See "environment variables" section in the docs
    volumes:
      - ${APP_DATA_DIR}/data/config:/config # Always start the path with ${APP_DATA_DIR}/data/. This will put all data inside app-data/my-app/data
      - ${APP_DATA_DIR}/data/projects:/projects
    ports:
      - ${APP_PORT}:8443
    networks:
      - tipi_main_network # That should not be changed
    labels: # Use your editors search and replace feature to replace all instances of "myapp" with your app name in the traefik labels
      # Main
      traefik.enable: true
      traefik.http.middlewares.myapp-web-redirect.redirectscheme.scheme: https
      traefik.http.services.myapp.loadbalancer.server.port: 8443 # Should be the same as the app internal port so for this example 9443
      # Web
      traefik.http.routers.myapp-insecure.rule: Host(`${APP_DOMAIN}`)
      traefik.http.routers.myapp-insecure.entrypoints: web
      traefik.http.routers.myapp-insecure.service: myapp
      traefik.http.routers.myapp-insecure.middlewares: myapp-web-redirect
      # Websecure
      traefik.http.routers.myapp.rule: Host(`${APP_DOMAIN}`)
      traefik.http.routers.myapp.entrypoints: websecure
      traefik.http.routers.myapp.service: myapp
      traefik.http.routers.myapp.tls.certresolver: myresolver
      # Local domain
      traefik.http.routers.myapp-local-insecure.rule: Host(`myapp.${LOCAL_DOMAIN}`)
      traefik.http.routers.myapp-local-insecure.entrypoints: web
      traefik.http.routers.myapp-local-insecure.service: myapp
      traefik.http.routers.myapp-local-insecure.middlewares: myapp-web-redirect
      # Local domain secure
      traefik.http.routers.myapp-local.rule: Host(`myapp.${LOCAL_DOMAIN}`)
      traefik.http.routers.myapp-local.entrypoints: websecure
      traefik.http.routers.myapp-local.service: myapp
      traefik.http.routers.myapp-local.tls: true
```

If your app requires different docker-compose files for different architectures, you can use the following naming convention:

```bash
docker-compose.arm64.yml
```

If the user is running on an arm64 architecture, this file will be used instead of the default `docker-compose.yml`.

#### The `docker-compose.json` file (optional)

If you would like your app to have all our advanced features (like the ability to use only a reverse proxy or disable the app's port),
you can check our [Dynamic Compose](https://runtipi.io/docs/reference/dynamic-compose) section to add the new compose file.
In the future we are planning to mainstream this new dynamic compose. You would help us a lot by including this file since
it will make the later migration faster.

#### The `metadata/description.md` file

Here is located the long description of the app in markdown (html is supported too), usually a copy of the readme provided by the app's author.
Make sure that when using images they are coming from github or an image service since tipi doesn't support loading images from local storage in the description.

#### The `metadata/logo.jpg` file

That's a simple logo of the app in `.jpg` format. In order for the app to look good make sure to use an image of `512x512` pixels and that it
of course looks good in the dashboard. Additionally if you can it would be nice to try to avoid the white-background-logo format since it makes the app look
bad in the appstore.

#### The data folder

If your app requires default files or configuration, you can easily provide those by creating a `data` folder beside the app config.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="runtipi" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="my-app" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="config.json" />
        <FileTree.File name="docker-compose.yml" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="data" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="anything.conf" />
          <FileTree.File name="config.ini.template" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="metadata" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="description.md" />
          <FileTree.File name="logo.jpg" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Anything placed under data will be copied over `app-data/<app-id>/data` before installation. Then you can mount those files inside your compose file.

```yml
my-app:
  container_name: my-app
  restart: unless-stopped
  volumes:
    - ${APP_DATA_DIR}/data:/var/lib/config # Will mount the folder with `anything.conf` inside
```

If one of your files requires some dynamic values, you can use a template file. Let's take the example of a `config.ini` file that requires the `APP_PORT` variable.

```ini
[my-app]
port = {{APP_PORT}}
```

If you name your file `config.ini.template`, it will automatically replace the variables with the values defined in the environment variables.

For example if you put the previous example in `data/config.ini.template`, it will be copied over to `app-data/<app-id>/data/config.ini` with the `APP_PORT` variable replaced.

### Commit your changes

Once you're done, you can commit your changes to the repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add my-app"
git push origin master
```

### Test your app in your own instance

Before submitting your app, you can test it in your own instance. You can do so by adding your app repository to the `appsRepoUrl` property in the `settings.json` file.
Visit the [Using your own appstore repository](/docs/contributing/running-locally#using-your-own-appstore-repository) section to learn more.

### Submit a Pull Request

You can now submit a pull request to the repository.

- On GitHub, visit your repository and click on the "Pull requests" tab.
- Click on "New pull request" and fill in the title and description.
- Choose your branch and target the main repository at `runtipi/runtipi-appstore`.

</Steps>
