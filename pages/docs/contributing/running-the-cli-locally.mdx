# Running the CLI locally

## Overview

During development it is useful to be able to run the cli locally to test any changes you make.

## Requirements

- Rust needs to be installed
- Git needs to be installed

## Running the cli

You firstly need to clone the cli repository. This can be done with this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/runtipi/cli
```

Then you can run the cli with this command:

```bash
cargo run
```

If you need to build the cli you can do so with this command:

```bash
cargo build
```

If everything succeeds the cli should be located in `target/debug/runtipi-cli`.
