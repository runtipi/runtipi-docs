# Third-party services

## Telemetry

After install, runtipi will ask you if you agree to send anonymous crash reports to [Sentry](https://sentry.io). This is one of the best ways to help
the team if you are not able to contribute. These reports help the team to debug and resolve issues in a fast manner.
If you change your mind after enabling it, you can disable the option in the settings page of the dashboard or by adding
the following option in your `settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "allowErrorMonitoring": false
}
```

Runtipi does not have any user-tracking or analytics feature. It does not collect any data about you or your usage as an individual or as a group.
