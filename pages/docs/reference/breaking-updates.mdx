# Breaking updates

## Introduction

This page is dedicated to describe breaking updates and guide you through the process of updating your instance to the newer versions.

## Update from 2.x.x to 3.0.0

In the version **3.0.0** we completely re-wrote the `runtipi-cli` tool.
The new CLI is written in Rust and it is much more stable, faster and smaller than the previous version.
You won't be able to update to the version **3.0.0** using the old node CLI. In order to update to the version **3.0.0** you will need to manually download the new CLI and
replace the old one.

We have prepared a script that will do the update for you. You can run it by executing the following command in your `runtipi` directory:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtipi/runtipi/master/scripts/update-2.0.0-to-3.0.0.sh | bash
```

Or you can do it manually by following these steps:

<Steps>
### Stop your instance

```bash
cd /path/to/runtipi
./runtipi-cli stop
```

### Determine the architecture of your system

```bash
uname -m
```

The output should be either `x86_64`, `arm64` or `aarch64`

If you are running `x86_64` architecture, the asset you need to download is `runtipi-cli-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
otherwise you need to download `runtipi-cli-linux-aarch64.tar.gz`.

### Download the new CLI in your `runtipi` directory

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi/releases/download/v3.0.0/<asset-name> | tar -xz
```

### Remove the old CLI

```bash
rm runtipi-cli
```

### Rename the new CLI

```bash
mv runtipi-cli-linux-<arch> runtipi-cli
```

### Make the new CLI executable

```bash
chmod +x ./runtipi-cli
```

### Start your instance

```bash
./runtipi-cli start
```

</Steps>

## Update from 1.x.x to 2.0.0

In the previous release (**v1.6.0**) we introduced the new rootless mode. After some reports from our users, we realized that the rootless mode is not working as expected.
This version messes up the permissions of the files and folders in the `runtipi` directory.

Updating to **2.0.0** requires you to manually run the update script with `sudo` privileges in order to fix the permissions.

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli update v2.0.0
```

## Update from 0.x.x to 1.0.0

In the version 1.0.0 we officially dropped support for 32-bit systems. If you are running 32-bit system, you will need to upgrade to 64-bit system. If you are running 64-bit system, you can safely upgrade to the version 1.0.0 without any manual steps

```bash
sudo ./scripts/system.sh update
```
