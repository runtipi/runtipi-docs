# Folder Structure

In this section, we will describe the folder structure of the project.
Here is a look at the folder structure after installation:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="runtipi" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="apps" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="app-data" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="logs" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="media" defaultClosed>
      <FileTree.Folder name="data" defaultClosed>
        <FileTree.Folder name="books" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="comics" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="images" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="movies" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="music" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="podcasts" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="roms" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="tv" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="downloads" defaultClosed>
        <FileTree.Folder name="watch" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="completed" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="incomplete" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="torrents" defaultClosed>
        <FileTree.Folder name="watch" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="completed" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="incomplete" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="usenet" defaultClosed>
        <FileTree.Folder name="watch" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="completed" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="incomplete" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="repos" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="state" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Apps

The `apps` folder contains all the apps that are installed on the device.
Each app is a folder with the app name. The app folder contains the app's config file and it's `docker-compose.yml` file.

You can edit the config file to change the app's settings. However, those changes will be overwritten when the app is updated.
If you want to make permanent changes to the app, look at the [Customize app config](/docs/guides/customize-app-config) section.

## App Data

The `app-data` folder contains all the data of the apps.
It is the default location if there is no `storagePath` defined in the `settings.json` file (see [Custom settings](/docs/getting-started/custom-settings))
Each app has it's own folder with the app name. And all the data of the app is stored in this folder. (e.g. `app-data/nextcloud/data`)

## Logs

The `logs` folder contains all the logs of the apps. The logs are seperated into 3 files

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="logs" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="error.log" />
    <FileTree.File name="app.log" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

The `error.log` file contains all the errors that are thrown by the app. The `app.log` file contains all the logs that are printed by the app.

## Media

The `media` folder contains all the media files that are uploaded to the device. (e.g. images, videos, etc.)
`media` folder is an exception to the rule that all the data is stored in the `app-data` folder.
This is because the media files are not app specific and can be used by multiple apps.
For example the `*arrs` apps use the media folder to store the downloaded media files.

## Repos

The `repos` folder contains the app store repositories. Each repository is a folder with the repository id.
If add a custom repository in your `settings.json` file, it will be downloaded to this folder and consumed by the dashboard.

## State

The `state` folder contains the state of your instance. It contains the `settings.json` file which contains the custom settings of the installation alongside some other files necessary for runtipi to run.
