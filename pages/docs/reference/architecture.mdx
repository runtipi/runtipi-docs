# Architecture

## Overview

<Image src={archDiagram} alt="Architecture Diagram" />

## Technologies

Runtipi is built using a modern web architecture and emphasizes on end-to-end type safety. The following technologies are used:

- [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) - Reverse proxy and load balancer
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Containerization
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed superset of JavaScript
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation
- [Drizzle-ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) - Type safe ORM
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Database
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) - In-memory data structure store
- [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io/) - Job queueing system

## Reverse Proxy

Traefik is used as a reverse proxy and load balancer. It is configured to automatically detect new services and configure them to receive traffic from the internet.
Each service is automatically configured to be able to receive an SSL certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) using the [HTTP Challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#http-01-challenge).

## Applications

Docker is used to containerize the application. Each service is built into a Docker image and deployed using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
Each app you install is deployed as a separate Docker Compose project. This allows you to easily manage each app independently.
All apps are deployed to the same network, allowing them to communicate with each other.
