# Environment variables

Here is a list of environment variables used by runtipi and their usage. These values are set in the `.env` file and cannot be manually changed as the file is generated by the `start` command.
You can change some values by using [custom settings](/docs/getting-started/custom-settings) or by using [custom environment variables](/docs/getting-started/custom-environment-variables).
