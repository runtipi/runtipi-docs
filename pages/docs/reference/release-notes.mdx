## 3.0.0

This is a breaking change release. Please read the [migration guide](https://runtipi.io/docs/reference/breaking-updates#update-from-2xx-to-300) before updating

- Allow the main compose file to be changed from user-config #1069 @steveiliop56

**Fixes**

- Fix the worker socket not working when the dashboard is exposed through domain #1074 @meienberger

## 2.3.1

**Improvements**

**Fixes**

- The app was crashing without any actionable insight for the user when the repo was not correctly cloned. Tipi now returns an empty list of apps and logs a helpful error #1060 @meienberger
- Previously when stopping tipi, if any folder or file that wasn't an actual app was present in the apps folder (eg: `.DS_Store`) tipi was trying to stop this app. This was fixed in #1053 @MontejoJorge

- After an update, apps are now restarting again if it was running before update. @cchalop1 closes #906
- (DEV) - When testing an app store repo, it is now possible to directly include the URL with the branch name in the settings and that branch will be checked out. @0livier

## 2.0.0

**Fixes**

## 1.6.0

**New features**

- New language Greek, Turkish and Spanish thanks to @steveiliop56 @M1n-4d316e @loxiry help us translate to more languages via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/runtipi/invite?h=ae594e86cd807bc075310cab20a4aa921693663)

**Improvements**

- A huge amount of work has been done to refactor the core of the app entirely in order to be future-proof. Now, we have a fully featured message queue on top of Redis to handle failures, logs, retires, etc. In the past, Tipi relied heavily on a dozen bash scripts hard to test and maintain. Now the whole core has been rewritten in node and is compiled to a single binary file which is the CLI.
