# Custom environment variables

There are two ways to provide custom environment variables to Runtipi:

## 1. Auto-loaded environment file

Place a `tipi.env` file in your `user-config` directory and it will be automatically loaded when running CLI commands. This is the recommended way to set custom environment variables.

```bash
# Path: runtipi/user-config/tipi.env
PORT=8081
DOMAIN=example.com
```

## 2. Command-line environment file

When running CLI commands, you can override any environment variable by providing a custom .env file using the `--env-file` flag. This can be useful for testing or complex setups.

To use this method, create a .env file anywhere on your system and use the `--env-file` option when running CLI commands. The path can be relative to the runtipi-cli or absolute.

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli start --env-file ./.env.local
```

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli start --env-file /home/pi/.env.local
```

Note: Variables defined in the command-line environment file will override those in the auto-loaded environment file.

See [Environment variables](/docs/reference/environment-variables) for a list of all environment variables used by runtipi.
