# Why using runtipi?

If you are discovering Runtipi for the first time, you may wonder why you should use
it over other solutions and where it fits in your self-hosted stack. Or you may even
be wondering why we created Runtipi in the first place.

Runtipi is not an OS or a distribution, but a set of tools to help you manage your
self-hosted services. It is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and provide a
set of default configurations that work out of the box.

The project was initially created as a pet project to learn more about self-hosting and
containerization. It was born out of the frustration of having to manage configs, secrets,
logs, and networking for each service individually and through clunky web-based terminals
and unconfigured text editors over SSH.

## How it started

Runtipi started as a very opinionated set of Docker Compose files and shell scripts
targeted at a beginner audience. It was designed to be a one-stop-shop for all your
self-hosting needs. It was a great way to get started with self-hosting, but it was
not very flexible and did not scale well.

Since then, the community has grown, and we quickly realized that there is no such
thing as a one-size-fits-all solution. Runtipi has tried to evolve into a more modular
and flexible tool. While we are not completely there yet, we have a vision of a set of
tools that can be used by any self-hosting enthusiast, and that can be easily extended
and customized without any limitations.

## What are we trying to achieve?

Runtipi is not reinventing the wheel. We have no intention of creating a new container
runtime, orchestrator, or package manager. We are not trying to replace Docker, Kubernetes,
or Ansible. We are not trying to create a new Linux distribution or a new package manager.

Instead, we are trying to build a product which steps on the shoulders of giants. We envision
a future where self-hosting is as easy as installing an app on your phone. With the benefit of
being able to customize and extend your services as much as you want.

Here are a few principles we are trying to follow:

### Declarativeness

Too often, when installing a new service, we go through a series of configuration steps and
commands and end up with a service that is not reproducible. When it's time to move the service
to a new server or to update it, we completely forgot what we did and where we found the information.

We think that configuration as code is the way to go. By using a declarative configuration format,
we can easily reproduce the service on a new server or update it without having to remember all the
steps we took. Others can also replicate the service and understand how it works at a glance.

By working this way, we generate a self-documenting configuration that can be versioned and shared
with others. We can also easily track changes and roll back to a previous version if needed.

### Flexibility

While we are leveraging our own tools and configuration format, the resulting services is
always a standard Docker container configuration. This means that if you decide to move away
or if runtipi disappears, you can still use your services an run them with a simple `docker-compose up` command.

### Openness

The world of self-hosting is vast and diverse. Even if we tried, we could not create a
wall-garden of services that would satisfy everyone. We are trying to be as open as possible
to any service, any configuration, and any individual. We are not trying to lock you
into our ecosystem, but to provide you with the tools to manage your own.

## Where we're at

While we just described what our dream product looks like, you bet we are not there yet.
By joining the community, you won't get a perfect product, but you will get a product that
is constantly evolving and improving and that you can help shape. You will also get support
from a community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about self-hosting and who
are willing to help you with your journey.
