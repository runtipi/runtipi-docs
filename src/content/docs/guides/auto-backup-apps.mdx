# Auto backup your apps using cron

In this guide we will show you how to automate backing up all your apps every week, month or day using Runtipi's
new backup feature.

Thanks a lot to [Lancelot-Enguerrand](https://github.com/Lancelot-Enguerrand) for putting this script together.

<Callout type="warning">
  This script requires Runtipi version `v4.0.0` or above.
</Callout>

## Setup

<Steps>

### Create the backup script

Create a new script file (`.sh` extension) in the `runtipi/scripts` folder (if the folder doesn't exist you can create it manually)
called `backup-apps.sh` and paste the following code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# Usage: ./backup-apps.sh [daily|weekly|monthly|yearly] [stop|ignore]
# Default parameters are "daily stop"
 
# Specify your runtipi base path
runtipiPath=""
 
# Specify path to you backup reference list (optional)
backupListPath=""
 
# Storage path for the Apps
backupPath="$runtipiPath/backups"

# Specify backup retention - Number of backup file to keep for each schedule
dailyRetention=3
weeklyRetention=3
monthlyRetention=3
yearlyRetention=3

# Sleep Duration - How many seconds to wait after starting/stopping an apps
sleepDuration=10

# Default runtipi paths
appsDataPath="$runtipiPath/app-data"
appsPath="$runtipiPath/apps"
userConfigsPath="$runtipiPath/user-config"

# Define the temporary directory for the archive creation
archiveCreatingWorkDir="/tmp"

# App status - Set defaut value to started
appOrginalStatus='started'

# Check for runtipi path value
if [ -z "$runtipiPath" ]; then
    echo "Runtipi path not specified"
    exit 1
elif [ -d "$runtipiPath" ]; then
    echo "Runtipi path : $runtipiPath"
else
    echo "Runtipi path not found : $runtipiPath"
    exit 1
fi
 
# Default Parameters
backupTypeDefaultValue='daily'
stopAppDefaultValue='stop'

# Define retention policy
backupType="${1:-$backupTypeDefaultValue}"
# Change keepLast to adjust retention policy
case "$backupType" in
    daily)
        keepLast=$dailyRetention
        ;;
    weekly)
        keepLast=$weeklyRetention
        ;;
    monthly)
        keepLast=$monthlyRetention
        ;;
    yearly)
        keepLast=$yearlyRetention
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid backup type specified. Use 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly' or 'yearly'."
        exit 2
        ;;
esac

# Check Runtipi version
runtipiVersion=$(cat $runtipiPath/VERSION)
runtipiMajorVersion=$(echo $runtipiVersion | cut -d. -f1 VERSION | sed 's/^v//')
if [ "$major_version" -lt 4 ]; then
    echo "Runtipi version is $runtipiVersion, this script require at least v4.0.0"
    exit 4
fi

# Should Apps be stopped during backup
stopApp="${2:-$stopAppDefaultValue}"

# List all appstores
for appStore in $(ls $appsPath)
do
    # Check optional apps reference list
    refBackupList=$backupListPath
    if [ -z "$refBackupList" ]; then
        backupList=$(ls $appsPath/$appStore)
    elif [ -f "$refBackupList" ]; then
        backupList=$(cat $refBackupList)
    else
        echo "Invalid path for backup reference list file."
        exit 3
    fi
    # List all installed apps
    for app in $backupList
    do
        if [ -d $appsPath/$appStore/$app ]; then
            echo "Starting backup apps from $appStore appstore."
            
            # Stop the app if it was asked
            if [ "$stopApp" = 'stop' ]; then
                cd $runtipiPath
                appStatusCheck=$(docker ps -f name=^/$app"_"$appStore -q)
                if [ -z "$appStatusCheck" ]; then
                    appOrginalStatus='stopped'
                    echo "App $app is already stopped"
                else
                    appOrginalStatus='started'
                    echo "Stopping $app"
                    ./runtipi-cli app stop $app:$appStore
                    sleep $sleepDuration
                fi
            fi

            # Set destination app path
            backupAppPath="$backupPath/$appStore/$app"
            # Create destination directory if doesnt exist
            if [ ! -d "$backupAppPath" ]; then mkdir -p "$backupAppPath"; fi
            # Generate archive name
            backupFileName="$app-$backupType-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d').tar.gz"
    
            # Use backup directory as archive file destination
            archiveCreatingWorkDir="$backupAppPath"
    
            # Move to Working Directory for archive creation
            cd $archiveCreatingWorkDir
    
            # Declare source and destination path for directories in archive
            declare -A app_paths=(
                ["$appsPath/$appStore/$app"]="app"
                ["$appsDataPath/$appStore/$app"]="app-data"
                ["$userConfigsPath/$appStore/$app"]="user-config"
            )
    
            echo "Preparing $app files"
            tempArchiveDir=$(mktemp -d)
            for src in "${!app_paths[@]}"; do
                dest="$tempArchiveDir/${app_paths[$src]}"
                echo $dest
                # Ensure the directory exists
                if [ -d "$src" ]; then
                    # Create symbolic link for each directory
                    ln -s "$src" "$dest"
                elif [ $src = "$userConfigsPath/$appStore/$app" ]; then
                    : # echo "No user config for $app"
                else
                    echo "Directory $src does not exist, skipped."
                fi
            done
    
            # Creating archive
            echo "Creating $app archive : $backupFileName"
            tar -czhf "$backupFileName" -C "$tempArchiveDir" .
            # Remove temporary Directory
            echo "Removing temporary files"
            rm -rf "$tempArchiveDir"
    
            # Purge old backups of the same type
            cd "$backupAppPath"
            echo "Purging old $backupType backup for $app"
            ls -t | grep "$app-$backupType-" | tail -n +$((keepLast+1)) | xargs -r rm --
    
            # Restart the app if it was asked to be stopped
            if [ "$stopApp" = 'stop' -a "$appOrginalStatus" = 'started' ]; then
                cd $runtipiPath
                echo "Starting $app"
                ./runtipi-cli app start $app:$appStore
                sleep $sleepDuration
            fi
        fi
    done
done
```

The script takes 3 arguments:

| Accepted Values            | Description                                                                                                        | Default | Required |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `monthly`,`weekly`,`daily` | Set the name of the final backup, for example if you use `daily` the backup name will be `myapp-daily-date.tar.gz` | `daily` | no       |
| `stop`,`ignore`            | Stop the app before backing up or backup anyway.                                                                   | `stop`  | no       |

#### Manage retention
The script allows you to change for how long you want to keep backups, this can be configured by chaning the following values:

```bash
dailyRetention=3
weeklyRetention=3
monthlyRetention=3
```

Each number indicates the retention period for the backup, specifying how many cycles it should be kept before deletion. For instance, a daily backup will be deleted after 3 days, while a monthly backup will be deleted after 3 months etc.

#### Apps selection
You can restrict the apps to backup with a list:
- In the script, edit the `backupListPath` 
- Enter the path to a file describing what apps you want to backup, each app id in a new line.

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure to change the `runtipiPath` in the script to point to your actual
  Runtipi path.
</Callout>

### Make the script executable

In order for cron to run the script we need to make it executable, this can easily be done with the
following command:

```bash
chmod +x backup-apps.sh
```

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure you are in the `runtipi/scripts` directory before running the
  command above.
</Callout>

### Add the script to cron

Now it's time to add our script to crontab. We firstly need to open the crontab file using this command:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Then we can add our crontab line, in this example we will backup our apps every day of the week at 2 a.m and the first day of the month at 3 p.m.

```bash
# Every day from Tuesday to Sunday at 2 AM - daily
0 2 * * 2-7 /path/to/runtipi/scripts/backup_runtipi_apps.sh daily

# Every Monday at 2 AM - weekly
0 2 * * 1 /path/to/runtipi/scripts/backup_runtipi_apps.sh weekly

# Every 1st day of the month at 3 AM - monthly
0 3 1 * * /path/to/runtipi/scripts/backup_runtipi_apps.sh monthly
```

After adding our line we can save and exit and that's it! Now your apps will backup automatically!
