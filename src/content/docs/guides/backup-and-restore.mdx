# Backup and restore

When changing hardware or network infrastructure, it is sometimes necessary to migrate your install onto a new device. You can do so by following the following steps.

On your first server, navigate to the `runtipi` folder and stop Runtipi using the CLI

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli stop
```

Navigate to the parent directory and create an archive of the `runtipi` folder

```bash
tar -czvf runtipi.tar.gz --exclude='runtipi/media' --exclude='runtipi/repos' --exclude='runtipi/backups' runtipi
```

Send the archive to your second server. For example, using [magic-wormhole](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole).
On your second server, extract the archive where you want the Runtipi folder to live in.

```bash
tar -xzvf runtipi.tar.gz -C .
```

Start Runtipi on your second server using the CLI

```bash
cd Runtipi && sudo ./runtipi-cli start
```

<Callout>
  Make sure you have Docker installed on your second server before starting
  runtipi. An easy way to do so is to install a clean Runtipi instance on your
  second server, then stop it and replace the Runtipi folder with the one you
  just extracted.

You're ready to go! Make sure any shared folder or manual network config you may have performed on your first server is re-applied again on your new server.
