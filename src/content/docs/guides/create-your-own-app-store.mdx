# Create your own app store

As of Runtipi version `v4.0.0`, you can create and use your own custom app stores alongside the official one. This feature allows you to create, maintain, and share your own collection of apps.

<Callout type="info">
  This feature requires Runtipi version `v4.0.0` or above.
</Callout>

## Why create your own app store?

There are several reasons why you might want to create your own app store:

- Host specialized apps not available in the official repository
- Develop and test new apps
- Create an app store specific to your organization or use case
- Modify existing apps to better suit your needs
- Share your collection of apps with others

## Setting up your own app store repository

<Steps>

### Use the repository template

First, head over to the [Runtipi app store template repository](https://github.com/runtipi/example-appstore) and
click the "Use this template" button to create a new repository based on the template.
This will give you a starting point with the necessary structure and files.

[![Use this template](/images/create-appstore/1-use-template.png)]()

Give your new repository a meaningful name and make sure to set it as a public repository.

### Add your new store to Runtipi

Grab the URL of your new repository. It should look something like this:

```
https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-store-name>
```

Head over to your Runtipi instance and navigate to the settings page.
Click on "App Stores" and then "Add App Store".

Paste the URL of your new repository and give it a name. This name will be used to identify the app store in the Runtipi dashboard.

[![Add app store](/images/create-appstore/3-add-appstore.png)]()

You should see your new app store listed in the app stores section with the default Whoami app.

[![App store list](/images/create-appstore/4-appstore-list.png)]()

### Create your first app

First, clone your new repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
```

Open the cloned repository in your favorite code editor. Inside the `apps` directory, you'll find a sample app called `whoami`. You can use this as a template for your own apps.
Each app should be in its own folder inside the `apps` directory. The folder name should match the app's ID in the `config.json` file. For each app, you'll need:

1. A `config.json` file with app metadata (name, description, version, etc.)
2. A `docker-compose.json` file defining the app's services using the dynamic compose format
3. A `metadata` folder containing at least a `logo.jpg` image and a `description.md` file

We will add Nginx as an example app.

First create a new folder in the `apps` directory called `nginx`. Inside this folder, create two files: `docker-compose.json` and `config.json`.

Here's the `docker-compose.json`

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "nginx",
      "image": "nginx:1.25.3",
      "isMain": true,
      "internalPort": 80
    }
  ]
}
```

And it's corresponding `config.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Nginx",
  "available": true,
  "port": 8754,
  "exposable": true,
  "dynamic_config": true,
  "id": "nginx",
  "description": "Simple webserver to test your tipi install. An alternative to the hello-world app.",
  "tipi_version": 3,
  "version": "1.25.3",
  "categories": ["utilities"],
  "short_desc": "Open-source simple and fast web server.",
  "author": "nginx",
  "source": "https://github.com/nginx/nginx",
  "website": "https://www.nginx.com/",
  "form_fields": [],
  "supported_architectures": ["arm64", "amd64"],
  "created_at": 1691943801422,
  "updated_at": 1729872794208
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  See the [config.json options reference](/docs/reference/config-json) and the [Docker Compose](/docs/reference/docker-compose) reference
  for a complete list of available options.
</Callout>

Add a `description.md` file in the `metadata` folder with a description of your app. This will be displayed in the Runtipi dashboard.
Add a `logo.jpg` image in the `metadata` folder. This will be used as the app's icon in the Runtipi dashboard. Use a square image with a 1:1 aspect ratio.

The final folder structure should look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="my-store" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="nginx" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="metadata" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="description.md" />
          <FileTree.File name="logo.jpg" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.File name="config.json" />
      <FileTree.File name="docker-compose.json" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Commit and push your repository

Once you've added your app, create a new branch and commit your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b add-nginx-app
git add .
git commit -m "Add Nginx app"
git push -u origin add-nginx-app
```

### Create a pull request

Head over to your GitHub repository and create a pull request. This will allow you to review your changes before merging them into the main branch.
A default test suite will run to check that your app is valid and follows the Runtipi app store file format.

[![Create pull request](/images/create-appstore/5-open-pr.png)]()

Once the tests pass, you can merge your pull request into the main branch.

[![Merge pull request](/images/create-appstore/6-merge-pr.png)]()

### Test your new app

Go to the Runtipi settings page and click on the "Update App Stores" button. This will pull the latest changes from your repository and update the app store.
You can now try to install your new app.

## Best practices

Here are some best practices to follow when creating your own app store:

- **Use semantic versioning** for your apps, such as `1.0.0`, `1.2.3`, etc.
- **Avoid using `latest` tags** in Docker images as they can break your apps in the future
- **Test your apps thoroughly** before publishing them
- **Include comprehensive documentation** in your app descriptions
- **Regularly update your apps** to keep them secure and compatible with the latest version of Runtipi
- **Use dynamic compose format** which is required for Runtipi v4.0.0 and above

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your custom app store:

- Ensure your app's `config.json` and `docker-compose.json` files are valid using the validation tools
- Verify that the folder structure matches what Runtipi expects
- Check that the `id` field in `config.json` matches the folder name
- Make sure you're using the dynamic compose format correctly
- Look for errors in the Runtipi logs (located in `runtipi/logs`)


## Sharing your app store

Once you've created your app store, you can share it with others by providing them with your repository URL. They can add it to their Runtipi instance in the same way you did.

Consider documenting your app store with a README.md file in the repository root to help others understand what apps are included and how to use them.
