# Breaking updates

## Introduction

This page is dedicated to describe breaking updates and guide you through the process of updating your instance to the newer versions.

## Update from 3.x.x to 4.0.0 (Beta)

<Callout type="warning">4.0.0 is still a beta version</Callout>

In the version **4.0.0** we introduced a major new feature: multi app-store support. This feature requires you to update your folder structure to support multiple app-stores.
In previous versions, the folder structure was like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="runtipi" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="app-data" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="nextcloud" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="nextcloud" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

From now on, the folder structure will include a new sub-folder for each app-store. The new folder structure will look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="runtipi" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="app-data" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="<my-store>" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="nextcloud" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="<my-store>" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="nextcloud" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

We have prepared a script that will automatically update your folder structure to the new format. You can run it by executing the following command in your `runtipi` directory:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtipi/runtipi/release/4.0.0/scripts/temp-update-3.0.0-to-4.0.0-beta.sh | bash
```

Or you can do it manually by following these steps:

<Steps>

### Ensure you have a backup of your instance

You can refer to the [backup documentation](/docs/guides/backup-and-restore) for more information on how to backup your data.

### Stop all you applications

Navigate to your runtipi dashboard and stop all your applications one by one.

### Stop your Runtipi instance

```bash
./runtipi-cli stop
```

### Move your existing directories to a temporary location

Run each of the following commands in your `runtipi` directory:

Create a temporary directory to store your existing directories:

```bash
mkdir -p migration-backups
```

Move your existing directories to the newly created temporary directory:

```bash
mv app-data migration-backups/app-data
mv apps migration-backups/apps
mv user-config migration-backups/user-config
mv backups migration-backups/backups
```

Create the new directories:

```bash
mkdir -p app-data/migrated apps/migrated user-config/migrated backups/migrated
```

<Callout>
  **Note**: The name `migrated` is important. This is the new name of your
  existing app-store.
</Callout>

### Move back your existing directories to the new locations

Move back your existing data to the new locations. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
mv migration-backups/apps/* apps/migrated/
mv migration-backups/app-data/* app-data/migrated/
mv migration-backups/user-config/* user-config/migrated/
mv migration-backups/backups/* backups/migrated/
```

If you had a custom `tipi-compose.yml` file, you will need to move it back but
outside of the `migrated` folder. You can do this by running the following
command:

```bash
mv migration-backups/user-config/tipi-compose.yml user-config/tipi-compose.yml
```

### Make sure you have moved all your data

Check that you did not miss any app. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
ls -la migration-backups/apps
ls -la migration-backups/app-data
ls -la migration-backups/user-config
ls -la migration-backups/backups
```

It should print an empty list.

### Determine the architecture of your system

```bash
uname -m
```

The output should be either `x86_64`, `arm64` or `aarch64`

If you are running `x86_64` architecture, the asset you need to download is `runtipi-cli-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
otherwise you need to download `runtipi-cli-linux-aarch64.tar.gz`.

### Download the new CLI in your `runtipi` directory

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi/releases/download/v4.0.0-beta.5/<asset-name> | tar -xz
```

### Remove the old CLI

```bash
rm runtipi-cli
```

### Rename the new CLI

```bash
mv runtipi-cli-linux-<arch> runtipi-cli
```

### Make the new CLI executable

```bash
chmod +x ./runtipi-cli
```

### Start your instance

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli start
```

### Check your instance

Navigate to your runtipi dashboard and start all your applications one by one. Make sure everything is working as expected.

### Clean up

After you are sure everything is working as expected, you can delete the temporary directory:

```bash
rm -rf migration-backups
```

</Steps>

## Update from 2.x.x to 3.0.0

In the version **3.0.0** we completely re-wrote the `runtipi-cli` tool.
The new CLI is written in Rust and it is much more stable, faster and smaller than the previous version.
You won't be able to update to the version **3.0.0** using the old node CLI. In order to update to the version **3.0.0** you will need to manually download the new CLI and
replace the old one.

We have prepared a script that will do the update for you. You can run it by executing the following command in your `runtipi` directory:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtipi/runtipi/master/scripts/update-2.0.0-to-3.0.0.sh | bash
```

Or you can do it manually by following these steps:

<Steps>

### Stop your instance

```bash
cd /path/to/runtipi
./runtipi-cli stop
```

### Determine the architecture of your system

```bash
uname -m
```

The output should be either `x86_64`, `arm64` or `aarch64`

If you are running `x86_64` architecture, the asset you need to download is `runtipi-cli-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
otherwise you need to download `runtipi-cli-linux-aarch64.tar.gz`.

### Download the new CLI in your `runtipi` directory

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi/releases/download/v3.0.0/<asset-name> | tar -xz
```

### Remove the old CLI

```bash
rm runtipi-cli
```

### Rename the new CLI

```bash
mv runtipi-cli-linux-<arch> runtipi-cli
```

### Make the new CLI executable

```bash
chmod +x ./runtipi-cli
```

### Start your instance

```bash
./runtipi-cli start
```

</Steps>

## Update from 1.x.x to 2.0.0

In the previous release (**v1.6.0**) we introduced the new rootless mode. After some reports from our users, we realized that the rootless mode is not working as expected.
This version messes up the permissions of the files and folders in the `runtipi` directory.

Updating to **2.0.0** requires you to manually run the update script with `sudo` privileges in order to fix the permissions.

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli update v2.0.0
```

## Update from 0.x.x to 1.0.0

In the version 1.0.0 we officially dropped support for 32-bit systems. If you are running 32-bit system, you will need to upgrade to 64-bit system. If you are running 64-bit system, you can safely upgrade to the version 1.0.0 without any manual steps

```bash
sudo ./scripts/system.sh update
```
