**Fixes**

## 2.0.0

**Fixes**

## 1.6.0

**New features**

- New language Greek, Turkish and Spanish thanks to @steveiliop56 @M1n-4d316e @loxiry help us translate to more languages via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/runtipi/invite?h=ae594e86cd807bc075310cab20a4aa921693663)

**Improvements**

- A huge amount of work has been done to refactor the core of the app entirely in order to be future-proof. Now, we have a fully featured message queue on top of Redis to handle failures, logs, retires, etc. In the past, Tipi relied heavily on a dozen bash scripts hard to test and maintain. Now the whole core has been rewritten in node and is compiled to a single binary file which is the CLI.

- New language German and Hungarian thanks to @m-lab-0 @Schmanko help us translate to more languages via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/runtipi/invite?h=ae594e86cd807bc075310cab20a4aa921693663)
